# NEU Library Resource Borrowing System

## Overview
The NEU Library offers a variety of resources, including books, theses, capstones, internet access, journals, and newspapers. To enhance the flexibility and maintainability of the system, the borrowing functionality needs to adhere to the SOLID principles, particularly the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP). The goal is to create a robust system that can seamlessly accommodate new resource types in the future without violating other SOLID principles.

## Task
Refactor the existing code to implement the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) while maintaining adherence to other SOLID principles. The refactored program should be flexible enough to accommodate future resource types (e.g., audio books, e-journals) without requiring significant changes. Additionally, create a `TestProgram` to validate the refactored code.
